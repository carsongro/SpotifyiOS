## Notes

The base of this project is formed from the iOS Academy YouTube Series for building Spotify: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PR3UyfTWve9ZC7Yws0x6EGjBO2FGr0o

I have added many features and integreated with the Spotify iOS SDK to play full tracks and authenticate, etc.

This reposityory does not contain a client secret or api key, you can obtain your own credentials from the Spotify Developer website.
